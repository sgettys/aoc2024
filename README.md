# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

## Description

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024), a series of daily programming challenges running from December 1st to December 25th. Each day introduces a new problem, increasing in complexity, which is solved using **Rust**.

The challenges are a great way to improve programming skills, explore algorithms, and have fun during the holiday season. Each day's solution is organized in its own directory (e.g., `day_01`, `day_02`), and the code is structured to be modular and reusable.

## How to Run Each Day's Code

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/advent-of-code-2024.git
   cd advent-of-code-2024
   ```
2. **Install Rust**: Ensure you have Rust installed. You can install it using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/):
   ```sh
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```
3. **Run the Code**: To run the code for a specific day (e.g., day 1), use the following command:
   ```sh
   make run DAY=day_01
   ```
